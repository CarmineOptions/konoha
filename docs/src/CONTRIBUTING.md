# Contributor Guidelines

1. Task Claiming
    - Comment: 'I would like to take this task,' including the estimated delivery timeline (start and completion dates) and a brief summary of relevant skills (required for complex tasks).
    - Join the contributors' Telegram group for updates and discussions.
2. Task Assignment
    - Easy/Medium tasks: Assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. No further assignment required.
    - Complex tasks: Prospective assignees must outline their approach to the task. Assignments will be based on these proposals to ensure optimal match and prioritization.
4. Initial Commit Requirement
    - If no commits are made or the assignee is unreachable within 48 hours post-assignment, we reserve the right to reassign the task.
    - We also reserve the right to reassign tasks if it becomes clear they cannot be completed by the ODHack's end.
5. Submission Guidelines
