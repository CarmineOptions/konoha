## A toolkit for DAO-like governance on Starknet

Many projects on Starknet will need the same functionality: DAO-like governance, upgrades, token vesting, staking and airdrops,  treasury management, etc. On Ethereum, they can use adapt open-source solutions such as [Compound Governance](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/tree/master/contracts/Governance). No such solution currently exists for Starknet (with the noble exception of [Ekubo governance](https://github.com/EkuboProtocol/governance/tree/main/src)).

Originally, it was a rewrite of [Carmine Governance contracts](https://github.com/CarmineOptions/carmine-protocol/tree/master/contracts/governance) to Cairo 1.0, while also making them generic and useful for the rest of the community.

Currently, this is being developed mainly with community-wide use in mind.
